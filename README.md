## Game Overview

**Command Mode** is the primary game experience - start with 1 turret and 2 cities, then expand your defensive network through research and strategic upgrades. Manage resources (scrap, science), unlock technology trees, and build the ultimate missile defense system.

*Arcade Mode (classic 6 cities, 3 turrets) is temporarily hidden while Command Mode is being refined as the core experience.*
